            This program helps distinguish different DNA molecules by generating unique DNA barcodes using Python. 
            The user retrieves this data through a text file by inputting the number of sequences and the length of the 
            sequences needed. The barcodes are generated with the following criteria: GC-content ranging from 40% to 60%, no more than 
            2 consecutive identical nucleotides, exclusion of restriction sites for enzymes AgeI, AscI, BamHI, SbfI, and hamming distance of
            at least 3. The hamming distance refers to the number of positions, between 2 barcodes, where the nucleotides are different.
