            This project implements Luhn's algorithm using C in order to return the correct credit card company upon recieving a 
            credit card number from the user. The number is first determined as valid or invalid by determining the number of digits
            in the number. Then, if the total sum, resulting from Luhn's algorithm, ends with a 0, it is a valid number. The guidelines 
            for the credit card companies are as follows: Mastercards start with digits between 50 and 56 with 16 total digits, American Express 
            cards start with either 34 or 37 with 15 total digits, Visa cards start with 4 with either 13 or 16 total digits, and Discover cards
            start with 6 with 16 total digits.
